# Testing Repository

This repository contains a simple Python application with Docker support.

## Contents

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the container image for the application.
- `main.py`: The main Python script (not present in the current repository).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies (not present in the current repository).

## Dockerfile

The Dockerfile uses Python 3.9 slim image as the base and sets up the application environment:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

### Dockerfile Explanation

1. `FROM python:3.9-slim`: Uses the official Python 3.9 slim image as the base.
2. `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container to /app.
3. `COPY . /app`: Copies all files from the current directory to the /app directory in the container.
4. `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`: Installs the Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
5. `CMD ["python", "main.py"]`: Specifies the command to run when the container starts.

## Usage

To build and run the Docker container:

1. Build the image:
   ```
   docker build -t testing-app .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run testing-app
   ```

## Important Notes

- The `main.py` file is not present in the current repository. You need to add this file with your Python application code.
- The `requirements.txt` file is also missing. Create this file and list all the Python dependencies required for your application.
- Make sure to add both `main.py` and `requirements.txt` to the repository for the Dockerfile to work correctly.
